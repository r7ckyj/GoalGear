# GoalGear
 ## Project Summary
In this project, I analyzed the order log and stock control data for a fictional soccer equipment retailer, GoalGear Pro. Using SQL, I extracted insights on sales trends, inventory levels, and customer purchasing patterns. The goal of this analysis is to explore GoalGear Pro’s order log and stock control data to uncover trends in sales, inventory levels, and customer behavior. The analysis aims to identify key products, seasonal demand patterns, and areas where inventory management can be improved to optimize business operations. I utilized Tableau to create visualizations that displayed metrics such as revenue breakdowns and product performance. These insights could help streamline operations, optimize inventory management, and improve marketing strategies. The project showcases my ability to work with real-world business data, utilize SQL for analysis, and build intuitive visualizations to inform decision-making.

## About the Data
The datasets used in this project contain synthetic data generated specifically for analysis. Since I created the data myself (using the help of ChatGPT, Google Random Number Generator, and BehindTheName.com), it was already clean and no preprocessing steps were taken.

- Order Log Data: Contains information on customer orders, including order IDs, quantities, and purchase dates
-	Stock Control Data: Contains inventory records, including item IDs, current stock levels, restocking schedules, and unit prices
-	Imported csv’s into Azure Data Studio to be queried with SQL
