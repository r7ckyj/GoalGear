# GoalGear
 ## Project Summary
In this project, I analyzed the order log and stock control data for a fictional soccer equipment retailer, GoalGear Pro. Using SQL, I extracted insights on sales trends, inventory levels, and customer purchasing patterns. The goal of this analysis is to explore GoalGear Pro’s order log and stock control data to uncover trends in sales, inventory levels, and customer behavior. The analysis aims to identify key products, seasonal demand patterns, and areas where inventory management can be improved to optimize business operations. I utilized Tableau to create visualizations that displayed metrics such as revenue breakdowns and product performance. These insights could help streamline operations, optimize inventory management, and improve marketing strategies. The project showcases my ability to work with real-world business data, utilize SQL for analysis, and build intuitive visualizations to inform decision-making.
